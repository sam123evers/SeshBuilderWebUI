-users can search for poses in the database
-users can create a 'playist' of certain poses and save this playlist (called a sesh) to the database as belonging to them
-users can 'play' the playlists
	*users can add times to poses
	*users can select rest-time durations in between poses
-users can delete pose from database? (???)
